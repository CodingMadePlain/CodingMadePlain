# Master the Future of Web Development: Learn to Code!

The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly impacting web development, changing the skillset needed to stay ahead.

**Here are two essential keys:** 

1. Understanding code is essential for all programmers who want a future in this space. After all, AI can only write what you instruct it to.
*The need to understand how to code has never been greater.*

2. Anyone can prompt an AI model. But the ability to systematically control the model behaviour through context management, precise instructions, and iterative refinement distinguishes highly effective practitioners from casual users.
